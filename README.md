# C-programs
These are the projects that I've done in the C-programming language class at University of Bologna: engineering and computer science (Cesena campus).
Period: September-December 2018

To compile a single source .c:

```	gcc "file_name".c  ```

To compile multiple sources .c:

```	gcc "file1".c "file2".c "filen".c -Wall ```
